# m68140

Motorola 68k familly's 8th generation processor documentation and tools

The M68140 is the latest incarnation of the now almost 40 years old M68000 processor familly. It is the most powerful descendant of the brillant cpu architecture that set a new level of computing capabilities from the end of the 70s and the early 80s.

Through the 80s, 90s and 00s, the Motorola processors evolved from a 16/32 bits architecture to the most advanced processing unit that set a new threshold in computing farm throughput as well as home entertainment, providing the finest technology and power efficiency for the most affordable price.

- Generation 1, 16 bits ALU/32 bits registers

1979 : 68000 - orthogonal instruction set, 6 bytes prefetch<br>

1982 : 68010 - restartable instruction, virtual memory support<br>
1983 : 68012 - multiprocessing support, 31 bits address bus<br>

- Generation 2, full 32 bits ALU and registers

1984 : 68020 - added addressing modes, external coprocessors<br>
1987 : 68030 - integrated PMMU, 3 stages pipeline<br>

- Generation 3, pipelined

1991 : 68040 - integrated FPU, 6 stages pipeline<br>
1993 : 68050 - canceled, merged with the 68060 project<br>

- Generation 4, superscalar

1994 : 68060 - superscalar, 10 stages pipeline<br>
1996 : 68070 - added 16 bits ISA, integrated SIMD and DSP, pipelined FPU<br>

- Generation 5, full 64 bits and RISC architecture 

1999 : 68080 - new core based on the unreleased 88160 CPU, 1 GHz reached<br>
2001 : 68090 - added VLIW ISA, virtualization, improved low power modes<br>

- Generation 6, multi-cores and variable symmetric multi-processing 

2004 : 68100 - dual and quad cores, simultaneous hardware multithreading<br>
2007 : 68110 - up to eight cores, added companion core for low power modes<br>

- Generation 7, APU, GPGPU and asymmetric heterogeneous multi-processing

2010 : 68120 - integrated multi-core GPU, UVD and FPGA, massive MCU<br>
2014 : 68130 - 32 cores version, added auto-clustering capabilities<br>

- Generation 8, optronic, fuzzy logic and quantum computing

2017 : 68140 - new hybrid photonic core, integrated FPQA<br>

With the introduction of heterogeneous asymetric fuzzy multi processing using fpqa (qbits arrays) as a world first in a consumer available product, Motorola sets another leap forward from its most direct opponent Dec/Cray, often named as "Decay" since they bought Intel in the middle of the 00s.

The new processor stays pin compatible with the 68100 line and up, thanks to the versatile MSocket technology introduced in 2002, and still in use after more than 15 years. The processor itself can be upgraded with more mram cache and qram using the nano simm slots on both sides of the 2 inches wide component.

Using upgraded replicated phase looped light harmonics as internal computation mechanism as well as external transport protocol on multi mode optical paths, the hybrid optronic processor can now achieve breakthrough performances equivalent of the Alpha 21974 running at 66.6 GHz but with only a 42 W TDP.
